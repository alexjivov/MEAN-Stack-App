# MEAN-Stack-App

We are going to make an MEAN App with Angular 4. The App is going to be a very simple Todo App. The first part is about developing the NodeJS Bakcend, The second Part will contain the Angular App.

Also from the get go we are going to use some good practices like using controllers, services to discipline our code instead of mashing all of them together.
